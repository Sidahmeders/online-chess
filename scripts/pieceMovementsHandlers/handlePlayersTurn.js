// Video Intruduction Script About me for my upwork profile
/**
Hi, Thank you so much for checking out My profile, my name is Ahmed and I'm a software engineer and full-stack web developer.
I have more than 3 years of hands-on experience building web applications and services, and I have a strong knowledge
of the inner workings of JavaScript, Node, and React.

and throughout my career, i managed to work on 50+ projects, some of them were passion projects or project-based-learning
and some were projects that I dived deep into to fix bugs, add new features, or improve performance
and some of them are projects that I built from scratch, so either way, I would love to hear about your project,
and most importantly how can I help you.

contact me today so we can schedule a quick introduction call to ensure that I will be a great fit for you
Thank you so much for checking out my profile. and I look forward to meeting you.

and by the way, if you can see this part of the video, you're likely gonna be one of my first clients on Upwork
and for that, I'm gonna be giving an extra 20 hours of free work for each client to spend more than 200$ on my gig.
